* TODO Generalize the Expr enum to include list and symbol variants so arbitrary S-expressions can be represented.
* TODO Rework parsing to support variadic forms, negative numbers, floats, and build nested lists instead of operator trees.
* TODO Introduce an evaluation layer with a Value enum, environment handling, and arithmetic dispatch through that environment.
* TODO Add core special forms (define, lambda, if) plus unit tests that cover parsing and evaluation.
